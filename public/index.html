			<h1>Creating web-site from utter scratch and libraries on Node.js and Express as a lonely Full-stack web architect.
			</h1>
			<p>
			I always wanted to start myself some nice blog, where I would share my ideas and thoughts, or maybe even insights on things I discovered, learned or that just got into my mind and started jogging around it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alongside with that I also liked to tinker with servers and “stuff”.</p>
			<p>
			And both of these things I never really done solidly. Yes, I worked part network engineer while doing some projects and building up layers to support application’s backend, but I never had solid thing that I built over long period of time.</p>
			<p>
			So, these “problems” lead me to deciding to create and maintain a fully custom-built blog-site-etc. To tinker and to concentrate my efforts on it. Also, I’ll document all (I hope to, at least) my progress in the form of small tutorials of creating my web-site from scratch. (I also hope to share some of my experience with multitude of programming oriented things I learned along my way)</p>
			<h2>
			To the stars! (or routing via ‘*’ precisely speaking)</h2>
			<p>
			From the get-go stack that I plan to use:</p>
			<dl>
			<dt>Back</dt><dd>Node.js via Express, MongoDB via Monk</dd>
			<dt>Front</dt><dd>React with MobX</dd></dl>
			<p>
			Also, I’m thinking about way to handle posts formatting and I incline towards either Markdown or custom-built parser(?) of texted jsx-like syntax, but latter would probably be huge overhead and unnecessary complications.</p>
			<p>
			For the sake of this tutorial I’ll be doing basic express setup via npm (if you don’t know any of fancy words I used so far, I’ll probably create small tuts about all of them and link them, but all in due time)</p>
			<h3>Tasty stuff</h3>
			<p>First, I’ll init npm package and git repo (latter absolutely optional, but kinda recommended):</p>
			<code>npm init</code>
			<p>
			This will show bunch of options, all of which I accepted with npm defaults. (You may want to pay attention to licensing, if you care about that part)</p>
			<code>git init</code>
			Which gave me a sublte response of <code>Initialized empty Git repository in …/htdocs/node/zarahia.com/.git/</code>.
			Next I installed back-end package(s) that will be used momentarily:
			<code>npm i -S express@^4</code>
			<p>Which installs express version 4 with most recent sub-version.</p>
			<p>
			For info: i is shorthand for install and -S is shorthand for –save (there’s also shorthand -D for –save-dev, that I’ll use in next-y tuts).</p>
			<h3>
			Real code go-go!</h3>
			<p>
			So far I’ve been setting up project and talking bunch of not-so-important words and sentences, now comes code that will server up a basic html:5 emmeted page with my oh so great article:</p>
<pre><code>// Require (import) and initialise express
const express = require('express');
const server = express()
// Set up port depending on current env (extra tut on this in the future)
const PORT = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 80 : 81
// Setting up basic route that will return any static file (basically any file found on server with extension and not normal request like example.com/catalog)
server.use(express.static('public'));
// Start listening and log out port that was used
server.listen(PORT, function () {
console.log(`Example app listening on port ${PORT}!`)
})</code></pre>
			<p>It gives me small console response of <code> Example app listening on port 81!</code> and takes terminal out of my control to keep node process alive.</p>
			<p>If I go to ‘localhost:81’ in my browser I get following nice view</p>
			<img src="nope" alt="raw html pic">
			<p>
			Ah, unformatted raw HTML, sorry that you have to cleanse your eyes now, but it was necessary. But it served my index.html, just as expected.</p>
			<p>
			So, I’ve got myself cool Node.express server going, yay!</p>
			<p>
			Yes, I know that’s just express’ own get started code with small static touch, but it’s start nonetheless.</p>
			<p>
			Next I’ll format my html file into something nice to look at. One step at a time.</p>
			<p>
			P.S. you may ask where’s routing through ‘*’, it’s somewhat like static files work, but also I planned to set up React in this tut, but it’s getting so much bigger than anticipated, so in other tuts to go.</p>
